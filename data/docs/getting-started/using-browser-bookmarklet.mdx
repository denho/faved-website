> [!NOTE]
> A bookmarklet is a bookmark stored in a web browser that contains a JavaScript command that executes on user click.
> Unlike browser extension, bookmarklet is lightweight and secure, as it doesn't add any elements or scripts on page, and can only access the page when you run it.
>
> - Has no access to your page data until it is activated
> - Doesn't require installing any browser extensions
> - Works in all modern desktop and mobile browsers
