Depending on whether you previously completed the [Quick Installation](docs/getting-started/installation#quick-installation) or the [Advanced Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation#advanced-installation),
the steps for updating Faved to the latest version will differ. Please refer to the corresponding section below for detailed instructions.

## Updating after Quick Installation

Follow these steps if you installed Faved using the [Quick Installation](docs/getting-started/installation#quick-installation) method.

### 1. Pull the latest stable image from Docker Hub

```bash
docker pull denho/faved
```

### 2. Stop and remove the running container

```bash
docker stop faved
docker rm faved
```

If you changed the container name during installation, replace `faved` with the name you used.

### 3. Start a new Docker container

```bash
docker run -d --name faved -p 8080:80 -v faved-data:/var/www/html/storage denho/faved
```

Done! You now have the latest version running.

## Updating after Advanced Installation

Follow these steps if you set up Faved using the [Advanced Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation#advanced-installation) method.

### 1. Pull the latest `docker-compose.yml` [file from the official repository](https://github.com/denho/faved/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) to your Faved instance directory

```bash
cd faved-app
rm docker-compose.yml
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denho/faved/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
```

### 2. Recreate the Docker service with the latest image pulled from Docker Hub

```bash
docker compose up --pull always -d
```

Done! You now have the latest version running.
