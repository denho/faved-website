This guide will walk you through installing Faved on your computer or server.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Docker installed on your machine. If you don't, visit [this link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) first to proceed with Docker installation.

Docker is the recommended and the only official installation method at the moment.
It allows to get Faved up and running in an isolated environment in just a few minutes without any extra dependencies, significantly improving installation speed, security, and experience.

## Quick Installation

This quick installation method is recommended as the fastest way to get started with Faved. It allows you to set up the application with minimum steps, making it ideal for users who want to explore its features or test it in a local environment on their computer.

### Step 1: Pull the latest image from Docker Hub

```bash
docker pull denho/faved
```

### Step 2: Start the Docker container

```bash
docker run -d --name faved -p 8080:80 -v faved-data:/var/www/html/storage denho/faved
```

This command will:

- Run the container in the background (`-d`).).
- Name the container `faved` (`--name faved`).
- Map port `8080` on your host to port `80` inside the container (`-p 8080:80`). You can change `8080` to any port you prefer.
- Create and mount a named volume called faved-data to application storage directory inside the container (`-v faved-data:/var/www/html/storage`).

### 3. Finish setup in application

Once the container is running, you can access the Faved application in your web browser at http://localhost:8080.

The first time you visit, you'll be prompted to set up the database. Just click "Create Database" to proceed and finish the installation.

## Advanced installation

This installation method is recommended for server environments, though it’s also suitable for local setups. While it requires a few more steps than the Quick Installation, it provides important advantages:

- **SSL configuration**: Enables you to set up an SSL certificate, allowing your Faved instance to run over a secure HTTPS connection — essential for deployments on public endpoints and domains.
- **Seamless updates**: Makes it possible to update to the latest version with minimal, almost unnoticeable downtime.

### 1. Create a new directory for your Faved installation

```bash
mkdir faved-app
cd faved-app
```

### 2. Copy the `docker-compose.yml` [file from the official repository](https://github.com/denho/faved/blob/main/docker-compose.yml) to your new directory

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denho/faved/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yml
```

### 3. Change the application default ports (optional)

By default, the application will run on port `8080`. When you are installing on a server, you probably want to use port 80.

If you want to change the default port, create an `.env` file with the corresponding environmental variables, like this (change the port to the desired one):

```bash
echo 'PORT=80' >> .env
```

If you are planning to use your own domain with an SSL, also add the following variable:

```bash
echo 'SSL_PORT=443' >> .env
```

### 3. Start the Docker service

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### 4. Enable SSL for your domain (optional)

If you are planning to use your own domain with an SSL, run the following command to install a Let\'s Encrypt certificate (replace `yourdomain.com` with your domain name):

```bash
docker compose exec -it apache-php sh -c "certbot --apache -d yourdomain.com"
```

### 5. Finish setup in application

Once the container is running, you can access the Faved application in your web browser under the local or remote address and the port you've set up.

Typically, the URL will be:

- http://localhost:8080 for a local installation (if you changed the default port number, replace `8080` with the port you've set)
- https://example.com for a server installation with a domain and SSL enabled
- http://206.189.108.11 for a server installation without a domain (replace `206.189.108.11` with your actual server IP address)

The first time you visit, you'll be prompted to set up the database. Just click "Create Database" to proceed and finish the installation.
