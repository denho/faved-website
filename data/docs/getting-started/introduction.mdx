## What is Faved?

Faved is a free, open-source, self-hosted bookmark manager designed to help you organize, categorize, and access your saved web content from anywhere.

Unlike cloud-based bookmark managers, your data stays with you, giving you complete control over your bookmarks and ensuring full privacy.

## Key Features

- **Self-Hosted**: Run it on your own computer, server, or cloud hosting and ensure your data belongs to you.
- **Open Source**: The code is open for you to inspect, modify, and contribute to.
- **Advanced tagging system**: Organize bookmarks with custom nested tags. Apply different styling to tags and pin important tags at the top for quick access.
- **Responsive UI**: Works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile without the need to install a separate app on every device you use.
- **Lightning Fast**: Blazing performance even with big collections.

## Who is Faved For?

Faved is a perfect choice for:

- Privacy-conscious users who want control over their data
- Researchers managing large collections of references
- Developers organizing technical resources
- Anyone tired of cloud bookmark services shutting down or changing terms
