In a world where every digital service wants to control your data, I believe it’s important to have an option to keep your data secure from trackers and advertising networks. That’s why I built **Faved**: an open-source, self-hosted bookmark manager that gives you complete control over your saved web content and links.

### 🧠 Why I Built Faved

I was tired of using third-party apps that vanish or lock away your data, and bloated tools that try to be everything except what I actually need: a fast, reliable way to save and organize links.
Faved is designed to be:

- **Private** - your data is stored locally and stays with you forever.
- **Simple** - clean UI, fast loading and zero clutter.
- **Flexible** - organize links your way with nested tags.
- **Accessible** - a web app that works in any browser on every device.

Whether you’re a researcher, developer, digital minimalist, or someone who’s tired of letting good links vanish into the void - Faved is for you.
⠀

### 🔍 Key Features

- **Self-hosted**: Run it on your own computer, server, or cloud hosting and ensure your data belongs to you. Never lose access to your stored information because of the app shutdown.
- **Advanced tagging**: Organize links with custom-styled nested tags. Faved tagging system is inspired by Gmail and Bear notes app, which is a better powerful alternative to a combination of flat collections + tags.
- **Responsive UI**: Works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile without the need to install a separate app on every device you use.
- **Browser bookmarklet**: Save links with one click, without a browser extension required. Faved bookmarklet is lightweight, and unlike browser extensions, it doesn't inject any code into your browsed pages or have access to them before you click to use it.
- **Blazing fast**: Built to be performant and snappy. Loads even big link collections in under 100 ms.
- **Simple and secure installation:** Docker is the default installation method, allowing to get Faved up and running in an isolated environment in just a few minutes without extra dependencies.
- **Open source**: MIT-licensed, transparent, and free for contribution.

### 🌱 What’s Coming Next

This is just the beginning. I'm actively working on:

- Saving full web page contents for data archiving
- Powerful search and sorting
- Multiple customizable layouts
- Offline access on mobile devices for uninterrupted access during travel
- Managed cloud hosting for better adoption among non-tech-savvy users
