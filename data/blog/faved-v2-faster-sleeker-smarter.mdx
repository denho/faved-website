Getting started is now effortless thanks to the new guided onboarding flow. Follow simple step-by-step instructions to set up authentication, install the browser bookmarklet, and import your existing bookmarks. The process takes just a few minutes and ensures your Faved instance is ready to go with everything in place for a smooth start.

### Importing bookmarks from browser (v2.2)

Switching to our app is easier than ever. You can now import bookmarks directly from your browser in just a few clicks. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and most other browsers are supported.

Import will fully preserve your browserâ€™s bookmark folder structure by converting folders into tags, which you can further reorganize as you prefer.

### Autofill page details when adding new link (v2.2)
