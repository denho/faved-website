With the latest release, Faved introduces support for **user authorization**, enhancing security for instances served from publicly accessible endpoints.

You can now secure your data with **built-in authorization**. Even if you‚Äôre already hosting Faved
behind a firewall or using server-level authentication, the in-app authorization adds an extra layer
of protection.

To enable it, go to **Authentication Settings** and create a user account by providing a username and password. Be sure to store your credentials securely.

You can update your credentials or disable authentication at any time through the same settings.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Settings Page

The new **Settings page** sets the stage for future customization, allowing you to tailor Faved to your workflow.

Currently, it includes two sections:

- **Authorization Settings** ‚Äî manage your login credentials and enable/disable authentication
- **Bookmarklet** ‚Äî install the Faved bookmarklet directly into your browser

More settings and personalization options are on the way!

### **Full Changelog**
